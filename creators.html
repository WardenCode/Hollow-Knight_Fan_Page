					<p>Team Cherry is an indie games developer in Adelaide, South Australia. Their mission is to build crazy, exciting worlds for players to explore and conquer.</p>
					<p>Hollow Knight is the first release by Team Cherry. Their team initially formed around game jams, but they bonded over their love for Zelda 2. Though they have all worked on games in the past, Hollow Knight is the culmination of the things they love in games.</p>
					<p>In 2017, they started working on the sequel to the original game: Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
